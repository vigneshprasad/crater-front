<h3>What are you bidding on?</h3>
<p>
    There are 1000s of communities out there. But most of them evolve into an area for spam, self-promotion or just become a ghost town. Jerry and Divya are launching their private discord community. What's different you ask? Only 100 people will be a
    part of it & each additional member has to pay a higher price to enter. This means that each additional user joining the group comes in with a higher intent & an objective to add & get value from other members.
